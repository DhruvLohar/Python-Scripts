Histogram
v<-c(9,13,21,8,36,22,12,41,31,33,19,17,18,2,3,4)
> hist(v,xlab="Weight",col="yellow",border="blue",breaks=5)

This histogram provides a visual representation of how the values in the vector v are distributed across different bins. Here's what it shows:

X-axis (Weight):
The numbers on the X-axis represent the value ranges (or bins) into which the data from v is grouped. For example, the bins are around 5-15, 15-25, 25-35, and so on.
Y-axis (Frequency):
The Y-axis indicates the frequency (or count) of values that fall within each bin. For instance, the bar heights tell you how many values fall within each bin.
Interpreting the Histogram:
Bins between 5 and 15: There are 2 values from the vector v in this range (8 and 9).
Bins between 15 and 25: There are 3 values (13, 21, 19) in this range.
Bins between 25 and 35: There are 2 values (31 and 33) in this range.
Bins between 35 and 45: There are 2 values (36 and 41) in this range.
Each barâ€™s height represents how many data points from v fall within the corresponding bin. The highest bars represent bins that have more values within their range. The lower the bar, the fewer the values.

What the Histogram Tells You:
This histogram shows that:

There are more values in the lower ranges (between 5 and 15, 15 and 25), suggesting that the data is somewhat concentrated in the lower range.
Similarly, there are a couple of larger values in the range of 35 to 45.
This distribution suggests that the values are spread across various ranges, with some concentrations around certain bins, especially the lower values (below 25).

BoxPlot
> v<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)
> boxplot(v,xlab="Manas",col="yellow",border="blue",breaks=5)

Explanation of the Boxplot:
Box: The box itself shows the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). The line inside the box represents the median (Q2).
Whiskers: The whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values in the data, unless there are outliers.
Outliers: Points outside 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles are considered outliers and will appear as individual points beyond the whiskers.
Interpreting the Boxplot:
The median line inside the box indicates the middle value of the dataset.
The box shows how the middle 50% of the data is spread (from Q1 to Q3).
The whiskers indicate the spread of the rest of the data.
Any outliers (if present) would be shown as separate points outside the whiskers.
In this case, the boxplot will help you understand the central tendency (median), the spread (IQR), and whether there are any outliers in your v vector.

ScatterPlot
v<-c(9,13,21,8,36,22,12,41,31,33,19)
> plot(v,xlab="Index",ylab="Value",col="blue",pch=19)

Explanation:
X-axis (Index): The index of each value in the vector v (1 for the first value, 2 for the second, etc.).
Y-axis (Value): The actual values in the vector v (9, 13, 21, 8, etc.).
Points: Each point on the plot represents a value from v and its corresponding index.
Interpreting the Scatter Plot:
The scatter plot gives a visual of how the values of v are spread out and allows you to see patterns or trends in the data.
For example, you can see which values are higher or lower and whether the values fluctuate randomly or follow a particular pattern.
This scatter plot shows how the values in v are distributed along the Y-axis, with their corresponding indices on the X-axis. If you had a second variable, you could plot the two variables against each other to observe relationships (e.g., correlation).
